We have chosen to work on data from the film industry, and more specifically on cinemas and film admissions in France.
\nMovies have been an integral part of our lives and have been entertaining us for a long time. They provide a way for us to escape from the reality of our daily lives, can serve as a source of education and inspiration, teach us about different cultures, historical events, and social issues, evoke emotions and promote empathy, etc. 
\nWith the advancement of technology and data analysis, it has become increasingly important to understand the trends, patterns, and success factors in the movie industry. There are several use cases where the data can be very useful and impactful for cinemas. Data is important for cinemas as it can be used to inform decisions about marketing campaigns, predictive analytics, and audience insights. Data-driven advertising can help improve ticket sales, while first-party data collected from consumers can create a better moviegoing experience. Data science can also be used to make the movie business more successful by understanding the audience's preferences and reactions to stories, which is very important because the movie industry is a massive market, with billions of dollars in revenue every year.
