# Data Vizualisation Project

We have chosen to work on data from the film industry, and more specifically on cinemas and film admissions in France.

Movies have been an integral part of our lives and have been entertaining us for a long time. They provide a way for us to escape from the reality of our daily lives, can serve as a source of education and inspiration, teach us about different cultures, historical events, and social issues, evoke emotions and promote empathy, etc. 

## Our dataset
The dataset used here is called *Géolocalisation des cinémas actifs en France* and has been published by the *CNC* (French organization for cinematography). It is an open-source dataset, directly available from the CNC website (https://www.cnc.fr/professionnels/etudes-et-rapports/donnees-cartographie-geolocalisation-des-cinemas-actifs-en-france_227811)

Here are the questions that we focused on regarding this dataset: 
- What are the entries proportion depending on the film's nationality for each district in Paris?
- In which departments are seats the most/least utilized?
- How is the number of seats in cinemas related to the population in urban areas?
- Is the number of tickets sold in a cinema always related to the number of showings planned?
